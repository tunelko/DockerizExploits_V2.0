# Description 
An automatic builted enviroment to run isolated CTF exploit levels with Docker. 

# Features
You can define whatever on your Dockerfile. Keep in mind that exploit VM is designed to run five levels (level1, level2, ...) but you can configure as many as you want, just be sure you add them on shell scripts and they are present.

* Game levels are designed by increasing difficult and escalating level's privileges so flags are always ssh level's password. 
* It runs with `--security-opt=seccomp:unconfined` (gdb needs a lot of syscalls, see syscalls.txt) but you can include your syscalls on a separate json file. 
* Customizable exploit levels, just put inside /home/levelXYZ, where XYZ is the level's number 
* Custom motd with pretty ascii banner (see above's image) 

# How to Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/tunelko/dockerizexploits.git && cd dockerizeexploits`
2. `./docker_start.sh`

# Customization

File decription: 
* **docker_start.sh** : builds and runs on docker. Init script. 
* **docker_clean.sh** : stops and deletes docker instance
* **docker_restart.sh** : clean, build and run instances. 
* [**perms.sh**](https://github.com/tunelko/DockerizExploits_V2.0/blob/master/perms.sh) : some binary access prevention and level's customizacion
* **gdbpeda.sh** : peda python script on all users for better debugging purposes
* **generate_ssh_passwords.sh** : not used. Purpose is generates SSH passwords dinamically. 


# Playing 
Connect via ``ssh level1@host -p1337`` with:
